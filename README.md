## Problem Statement 
A leading bank wants to analyze customer behavior, transactions, and loan performance. Your 
task is to use Power BI to clean, model, and visualize the data, and then create an interactive 
dashboard with advanced features for management insights.
## Dataset Description 
Dataset: Banking_Data.csv 
Column Name Description 
Customer_ID Unique ID for each customer

## Concepts used:
✔ Conditional Formatting (Table/Matrix + KPI Cards)

✔ Tooltips (Dynamic details on hover) 
✔ Bookmarks (Switch between Loan View & Transaction View) 
✔ Slicers (Filter by Age Group, Gender, Account Type) 
✔ Hierarchy (Year > Quarter > Month for Transaction Date) 

##  Deliverables 
• A .pbix dashboard with all requirements. 
• A short insight summary (2–3 slides) highlighting key findings.
